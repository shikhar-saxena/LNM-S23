# Associationism

We categorize neurons for linkage of ideas:

- How neurons are close together
- How frequent ideas are remembered
- How similar the ideas are

Pavlov Eperiment


## Some history

- Behaviourism (doing something and seeing the behaviour of the agent)
- Then came Mathematical modeling of this behaviour

# How are memories built from experience?

Our experiences build up. Then the connections in the neurons become stronger (based on the experiences).

John Locke argued that all memories are derived from experience

# Nature vs Nurture

- Nature: Something given to us biologically (when we were born). Like certain set of neurons and how they are connected (at birth).
